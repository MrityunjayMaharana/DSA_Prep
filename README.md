# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures in C++. Below is a detailed explanation of the topics covered in the `Binary Search` and `Bit Manipulation` folders.

## Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

### Files and Functions

## Bit Manipulation

Bit Manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or binary digits, which are the most basic form of data in computing and digital communications. Bit manipulation is used in optimizing space and time complexity.
